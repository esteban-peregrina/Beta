This code was a personnal attempt at creating a neural network from scratch. 

It was done in April 2023 durign my first year of french "CPI".

I had previously followed a tutorial to make my first NN in C trained on the MNIST database.

This second attempt's goal was to apply the knowledge of my C curriculum, especially using struct declarations, 
to build my NN (declaring each component, like neurons and layers, as a struct).
